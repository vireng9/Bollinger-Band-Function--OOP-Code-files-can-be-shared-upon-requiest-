# Bollinger-Band-Function --- Object Oriented Programming
Note - Code files are private and can be shared upon request.

## **Overview**
This repository implements Bollinger Bands — a popular technical analysis tool — using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The project is designed to be modular, reusable, and extensible for quantitative finance applications.

📌 **Key Features**
- OOP Design: Encapsulates Bollinger Band logic into classes and methods for clean, maintainable code.
- Customizable Parameters: Easily adjust moving average window size and standard deviation multipliers.
- Data Integration: Compatible with common Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) for seamless data handling and visualization.
- Visualization Support: Plot Bollinger Bands alongside price data for intuitive analysis.
- Extensibility: Can be extended to include other indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) within the same framework.

📈 **Applications**
- Trading Strategies: Identify overbought/oversold conditions, volatility squeezes, and breakout signals.
- Risk Management: Monitor price deviations from moving averages to adjust positions.
- Quantitative Research: Backtest strategies using historical data with modular OOP code.
- Educational Use: Demonstrates how financial indicators can be implemented with OOP principles.

⚠️ **Risks & Limitations**
- False Signals: Bollinger Bands may generate misleading buy/sell signals in sideways markets.
- Lagging Indicator: Based on moving averages, so signals may appear after price movements.
- Parameter Sensitivity: Choice of window size and standard deviation multiplier can significantly affect results.
- Market Conditions: Works best in trending or volatile markets; less effective in low-volatility environments.
